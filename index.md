## ‚ûï‚ûñ FedGMA
Implemented and trained FedGMA, a modified version of FedAvg that works on the concept of AND-Masked gradient update. The principle behind this algorithm is very intuitive: the more similar the gradients across the clients, the better the gradient descent of the server model. The main focus of this experiment is on two different hyper-parameters, the client probability threshold and the local client epochs. <br><br>

## üà≤ Black Box Meta-Learning
Implemented and trained an LSTM based black-box meta-learner for few-shot learning. The model was trained on the Omniglot dataset for K-shot, N-way classification, i.e. training a classifier to distinguish between N previously unseen characters, given only K labeled examples of each character. <br> <br>

## ‚ôüÔ∏è Graph Chess
An approach towards predicting the result of a game of chess using Graph Convolutional Operator. Given the past matches played by the players, a graphical model is constructed, and the neural model tries to predict a given match's outcome.<br> <br>

## üç∑ Beer Blurrer
Developed a framework to detect and blur alcoholic content in images. The first part of the frame-work is a YOLO-V3 model deployed to detect beer bottles. The latter part of the frame-work involves a unique adaptive thresholding algorithm for blurring the detected bottles. Acheived a MAP score of 99.19 %. <br> <br>

## üîê CoDoH: Classification of DNS over HTTPS
Two statistical models were utilized to perform two different classification tasks. The first one is to classify the network traffic as DoH vs. Non-DoH, and the second one is the classification of Benign DoH vs. Malicious DoH. Fine inferences were drawn from the results, and the highly impacting features were explained and justified for each class. <br> <br>

## üñºÔ∏è Automatic Image Captioning
Developed a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines computer vision and text generation. The encoder is an Inception V3 model that extracts the feature vectors. The decoder, made up of LSTMs, predicts the captions conditioned on the image‚Äôs feature vectors. <br> <br>

## üéôÔ∏è Trigger Word Detection
A neural network was designed to identify the trigger word ‚ÄòMervin‚Äô from the spectrogram of the given audio sample. CNNs were used to extract dense feature vectors from the audio spectrograms. Later GRUs were utilized to capture the temporal relationships in the extracted feature vectors. <br> <br>

## ü§¨Toxic Comments
Toxicity in Wikipedia comments was identified using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). The built model achieved a training accuracy of 95.3 % and was deployed using Streamlit. <br> <br>

## üíª Points and Co-ordinates
A 3 dimensional interactive mathematical environment was constructed using HTML and Javascript. This work is an open source contribution that was done during my internship at SRIP, IIIT Hyderabad in 2019. <br><br>
