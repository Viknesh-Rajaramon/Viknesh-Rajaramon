An approach towards forecasting the stock price using LSTM model. Given the stock ticker symbol, the dataset is retrieved from Yahoo Finance through web scrapping. The LSTM model trains and tries to forecast the stock prices for that particular dataset. <br><br>

## <img src="https://www.godigit.com/content/dam/godigit/directportal/en/contenthm/mandatory-traffic-signs.jpg" height="20" width="20"> Traffic Sign Classification
Implemented and trained an LSTM based black-box meta-learner for few-shot learning. The model was trained on the Omniglot dataset for K-shot, N-way classification, i.e. training a classifier to distinguish between N previously unseen characters, given only K labeled examples of each character. <br> <br>

## ‚ôüÔ∏è Graph Chess
An approach towards predicting the result of a game of chess using Graph Convolutional Operator. Given the past matches played by the players, a graphical model is constructed, and the neural model tries to predict a given match's outcome.<br> <br>

## üç∑ Beer Blurrer
Developed a framework to detect and blur alcoholic content in images. The first part of the frame-work is a YOLO-V3 model deployed to detect beer bottles. The latter part of the frame-work involves a unique adaptive thresholding algorithm for blurring the detected bottles. Acheived a MAP score of 99.19 %. <br> <br>

## üîê CoDoH: Classification of DNS over HTTPS
Two statistical models were utilized to perform two different classification tasks. The first one is to classify the network traffic as DoH vs. Non-DoH, and the second one is the classification of Benign DoH vs. Malicious DoH. Fine inferences were drawn from the results, and the highly impacting features were explained and justified for each class. <br> <br>

## üñºÔ∏è Automatic Image Captioning
Developed a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines computer vision and text generation. The encoder is an Inception V3 model that extracts the feature vectors. The decoder, made up of LSTMs, predicts the captions conditioned on the image‚Äôs feature vectors. <br> <br>
