## Stock Price Forecasting
An approach towards forecasting the stock price using LSTM model. Given the stock ticker symbol, the dataset is retrieved from Yahoo Finance through web scrapping. The LSTM model trains and tries to forecast the stock prices for that particular dataset. <br><br>

## Traffic Sign Classification
While building a self-driving car, it is necessary to make sure it identifies the traffic signs with a high degree of accuracy, otherwise the results might be catastrophic. To solve this problem we use CNN and Keras and built a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. Achieved an accuracy score of 94.37% <br> <br>

## üç∑ File Transfer System
Developed a simple file transfer system that can transfer files between two systems using the IP addresses provided they are connected through the same network using socket programming in Python. Threading enabled for sender to send a file to atmost 4 recievers simultaneously. <br> <br>
